Refugia are sites with a more stable climate and hydrology than the surrounding area. There is a growing recognition of the need to conserve refugia due to their role in conserving rare and endemic plant that might otherwise be more prone to extinction due to global change. These sites are believed to be vital in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa, an area whose exceptional number of plant species, including a high number of endemics, is under threat from the effects of global change. Despite the importance of refugia in the CFR, very little is known about their distribution. To fill this knowledge gap, I identify the distribution and character of refugia by mapping total species richness, the distribution of widespread species, narrow-range endemics (NREs), and wetland-dependent narrow-range endemics (WD-NREs) and exploring the environmental correlates of these distributions. I find that total species richness, the distributions of widespread species, NREs and WD-NREs exhibited topographic and longitudinal gradients, with more species found in the southwestern CFR and in the mountains. I also found that environmental stability and heterogeneity play a significant role in influencing total species richness and endemism. My findings suggest that long-term hydrologically stable sites, characterized by strong topographic features and cool, moist conditions, are primarily found in the Cape Peninsula and the southwestern CFR mountains and that these sites function as refugia for species in the CFR. These refugia face significant threats from groundwater abstraction, invasive species and climate change, and fine-scale maps and tools to monitor these microrefugia are required to effectively conserve their biodiversity.
